Python Test
====================

A palindrome is a word that reads the same backwards as forwards (e.g.
"detartrated".) Write a script to read any plain text document from stdin
(for example, use this file as a testset.) Filter for just the single-word
palindromes that are longer than 1 character. Output them, one per line, to
stdout. Preserve the order of first occurrence, but only output each
palindrome once.

Consider whether your code runs fast like a racecar, even on large inputs
(e.g. larger than RAM.) Under what circumstances might it have to deal with
an infinitely large input stream, and how well would it cope with that?

We have a tenet, that all non-throwaway code should be well tested, developed
using TDD, and should generally raise on unresolvable errors or ambiguities.

Don't forget to let us know what version of Python you're using, and generally
present your solution so that we can run your code with minimum of fuss.
